## About

<img align="right" width="600" src="https://i.ibb.co/Jxy84L1/spotter-ios-app-screenshots.png?" />

A simple app, that lets users record and categorise observations on a map and attatch additional details including: date/time, description, contatcs, multi-media, geo-data and tags.

It was developed with the aim of learning more about Swift and iOS development, specificially around working with maps, date-times, contacts, searching, auth and offline caching.

#### Features
- User registration and authentication
- Add geographical observations and attatchments
- List saved observations, or view them on a map
- View details of any given observation, and edit
- Cache unsaved data for upload, when offline


#### Status
Since this app was developed in 2015, and using Swift V1, many of the concepts and internal APIs may have changes, likely making a lot of the code obsolete. And because it was just built as a learning exercise, and the app doesn't really have any real-world uses, it isn't actively maintained.

#### Similar Projects
The [iOS-Observation-Tracker](https://github.com/OlliePoole/iOS-Observation-Tracker) by [@OlliePoole](https://github.com/OlliePoole) is very similar, and is probably much better written.

## Developing
Clone the repo, run `pod install` to fetch dependencies, then open the workspace in xcode. From there you can launch the simulator, build the app, and run the unit tests.
